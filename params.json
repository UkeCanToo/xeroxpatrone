{"name":"Xeroxpatrone","tagline":"Xerox Phaser 6130 Printer Cartridge Chip Reset Tool","body":"### Xeroxpatrone\r\n\r\nThis is a tool for resetting the chip that is included in the Xerox Phaser 6130 Printer Cartridges. Since Xerox wants you to buy a new toner cartridges even if you are able to refill them, they included a little EEPROM microchip to prevent self refilling.\r\n\r\nNow you can reset this little microchip inside the cartridge yourself.\r\n\r\n**Warning: I think using this will definitely void the warranty!**\r\n\r\nFurther Information can be found in the [project wiki](https://github.com/meyerd/xeroxpatrone/wiki)","google":"UA-7935872-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
