{"name":"Xeroxpatrone","tagline":"Xerox Phaser 6130 Printer Cartridge Chip Reset Tool","body":"### Xeroxpatrone\r\n\r\nThis is a tool for resetting the chip that is included in the Xerox Phaser 6130 Printer Cartridges. Since Xerox wants you to buy a new toner cartridges even if you are able to refill them, they included a little EEPROM microchip to prevent self refilling.\r\n\r\nNow you can reset this little microchip inside the cartridge yourself.\r\n\r\n****Warning: I think using this will definitely void the warranty!\r\n\r\n****UPDATES: Beware, that there might be a bug in the new XeroxpatroneV2 tool when writing chips with the EasyPC adapter. Until that issue is resolved, you might fall back to using the old command line software which also supports the Easy Adapter\r\n\r\n****UPDATES: Updated version 2 of the xeroxpatrone-tool. Now has a graphical user interfaces and supports a new usb-only adapter.\r\n\r\n##German/Deutsch\r\n\r\n##Other Printers/Parts\r\nA list of pointers to pages describing flashing other parts\r\n\r\n##EEPROMs\r\nAvailable and missing EEPROM dumps\r\n\r\n#Using other cartridges\r\nYes you can use 6130 cartridges in your 6140 printer and vice versa. Also Xerox Phaser 6125, Xerox Phaser 6128, Dell 1320c, Dell 2130cn and Dell 2135cn are more or less the same. Read here how it works.\r\n\r\n#For which Printers does it work?\r\nIt definitely works for the Xerox Phaser 6130. I think it should also work for the Xerox Phaser 6125, Xerox Phaser 6128, Dell 1320c, Dell 2130cn and the Dell 2135cn, since they use the same cartridges. It was just tried out: The Xerox Phaser 6140 uses exactly the same EEPROMS. Dumps for that printer can be found in the download section.\r\n\r\n#How to do it?\r\nFirst of all you need to have a i2c adapter for your PC. Something like this (recommended) or this (for the full i2c functionality). You also can download the schematics there and build it yourself. I think you will most likely have to do that since you need some sort of adapter to attach to the tiny pcb where the EEPROM Chip is located (try out something like this).\r\n\r\nThen either download a precompiled (sorry, only windows) version of the reset tool. Or build it yourself.\r\n\r\nWith that tool you can now read out the data on the chip and write the same or, more important, modified data back onto the EEPROM. Use xeroxpatrone --help for further usage instructions.\r\n\r\nIf you have binary dumps for printers which are not listed on the site please send them.\r\n\r\n#Easy PC Adapter\r\nReally easy and cheap to build PC adapter. You will need this executable to read/write your EEPROMS download\r\n\r\n##What else?\r\nFor effectively resetting a cartridge, you will need some EEPROM image of a full, new cartridge. Maybe I will eventually upload one here, or you have to read one image out yourself.\r\n\r\n##Missing DLLs on Windows\r\n\"MSVCR100.dll missing\" or \"MSVCP100.dll missing\" (Windows)\r\nYou need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable, available for Windows x86 and Windows x64.\r\nAny technical details\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nThe EEPROM chip is simply a M24C02 serial i2c bus eeprom with 2KBit. There are some pull up resistors around, but thats it. You can use any way to read and write on that you want. Just use this information here.\r\n\r\nSomeone testing it reported the programming went just fine with \"JDM-Programmer\".\r\n\r\n##EEPROM dumps\r\nI read out some EEPROM dumps from cartridges I own myself (download here). Feel free to use them and if you find something out about the encoding or the contents, maybe how to write a dump-\"generator\" to generate arbitrary fillings, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIf you get hold of any new dumps that are missing in the downloads section, please send them to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
